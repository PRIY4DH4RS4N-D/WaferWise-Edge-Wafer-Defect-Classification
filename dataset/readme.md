| Class               | Description                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Clean**           | Defect-free wafer regions used as baseline reference                     |
| **Bridge**          | Unintended electrical connections between adjacent metal lines           |
| **CMP**             | Surface scratches or dishing caused during Chemical Mechanical Polishing |
| **Open**            | Broken or incomplete interconnects leading to open circuits              |
| **LER**             | Line Edge Roughness affecting critical dimension control                 |
| **Stain**           | Chemical residue or discoloration from processing steps                  |

## 🎯 Why These 10 Classes Were Selected

- Represents commonly observed, high-impact semiconductor fabrication defects

- Covers both systematic and random defect types

- Classes are visually distinguishable, reducing label ambiguity

- Includes Clean class for robust defect vs non-defect learning

- Others class improves model generalization to unseen defects

- Balanced to achieve high accuracy under edge compute constraints

## 🔍 About the **Others** Class

The **Others** category is intentionally designed to improve model robustness and real-world usability.  
It includes:

- **Ambiguous defects** that do not clearly belong to a single class  
- **Partial or edge defects** appearing near wafer boundaries  
- **Imaging artifacts** such as noise, illumination variation, or focus distortion  

This design helps the model:
- Avoid forced misclassification  
- Generalize better to unseen fab conditions  
- Handle real inspection uncertainty at the edge


## 🖼️ Image Characteristics

- **Format:** PNG  
- **Color Space:** Grayscale (single-channel)  
- **Resolution:** **224 × 224 pixels**  
- **Source:** Public semiconductor inspection images collected from research papers and online repositories  
- **Preprocessing:** Resizing, normalization, and controlled augmentations (rotation, mild blur)

## ⚙️ Dataset Design Goals

- Enable real-time inference on edge devices

- Support ONNX export and NXP eIQ compatibility

- Balance model accuracy, size, and latency

- Reflect real fab inspection scenarios
